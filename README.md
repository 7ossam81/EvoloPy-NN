###EvoloPy-NN: An open source nature-inspired optimization Framework for Training Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network in Python

The EvoloPy-NN framework provides classical and recent nature-inspired metaheuristic for training Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. The list of optimizers that have been implemented includes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO). The full list of implemented optimizers is available here https://github.com/7ossam81/EvoloPy/wiki/List-of-optimizers


##Features
- Six nature-inspired metaheuristic optimizers were implemented.
- The implimentation uses the fast array manipulation using `NumPy`.
- Matrix support using `SciPy`'s package.
- More optimizers is comming soon.

##Installation
- Python 3.xx is required.

Run

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

(possibly with `sudo`)

That command above will install  `sklearn`, `NumPy` and `SciPy` for
you.

- If you are installing EvoloPy-NN onto Windows, please Install Anaconda from here https://www.continuum.io/downloads, which is the leading open data science platform powered by Python.
- If you are installing onto Ubuntu or Debian and using Python 3 then
  this will pull in all the dependencies from the repositories:
  
      sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev libgsl0-dev fftw-dev libglpk-dev libdsdp-dev
